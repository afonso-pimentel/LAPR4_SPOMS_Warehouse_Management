# USG9001
=======================================

**USG9001 - As software product client, I want the team (software product supplier) to prepare a presentation focusing on the following aspects: (i) main objectives of the system; (ii) adopted development process and planning; (iii) teamwork methodology and conflict resolution strategy; (iv) product quality; (v) expected results; (vi) 'turnkey' format for software delivery/sale; among others relevant aspects.**

This user story clearly states that a powerpoint presentation should be created, therefore, there is no engineering process attached to this user story.
